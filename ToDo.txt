Experiment with using Out-GridView for the summaries
Idea: if we were in the middle of a latency issue and we start getting errors, does that mean that the latency issue should be considered to be at an end?
	let's assume that we're in the middle of a latency moving avg scenario and we get a single time out or some such. should that mean we start over on the moving latency avg tracking?
		no. we should only conclude latency tracking when either
			a. the latency threshold issue (moving avg or otherwise) has ended, or
			b. the number of error pings has met the OutageMinPackets threshold
